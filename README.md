#Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is aimed at writing an outline of the requirement analysis in Software Development

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs or expectations of stakeholders for a new or existing software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs.

During requirement analysis, developers, analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to clearly understand what the system must do and the constraints under which it must operate. The output of this stage typically includes requirement specifications, use cases, and functional documents that guide the rest of the development process.

Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Clarity and Understanding:
It helps both the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s goals, reducing miscommunication.

Prevents Scope Creep:
By defining the scope early, requirement analysis prevents uncontrolled changes or additions later in the project.

Improves Quality:
Well-defined requirements ensure that the software meets user expectations and performs as intended.

Saves Time and Cost:
Detecting and resolving requirement issues early in the development process is far less costly than fixing them after deployment.

Provides a Solid Foundation:
It acts as the blueprint for design, development, testing, and deployment phases, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between a stakeholder’s idea and the technical solution, ensuring the software delivers real value to its users.

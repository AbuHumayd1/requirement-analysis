#Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is aimed at writing an outline of the requirement analysis in Software Development

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs or expectations of stakeholders for a new or existing software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs.

During requirement analysis, developers, analysts, and stakeholders collaborate to clearly understand what the system must do and the constraints under which it must operate. The output of this stage typically includes requirement specifications, use cases, and functional documents that guide the rest of the development process.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity and Understanding:
It helps both the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s goals, reducing miscommunication.

Prevents Scope Creep:
By defining the scope early, requirement analysis prevents uncontrolled changes or additions later in the project.

Improves Quality:
Well-defined requirements ensure that the software meets user expectations and performs as intended.

Saves Time and Cost:
Detecting and resolving requirement issues early in the development process is far less costly than fixing them after deployment.

Provides a Solid Foundation:
It acts as the blueprint for design, development, testing, and deployment phases, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow.

In essence, Requirement Analysis bridges the gap between a stakeholder’s idea and the technical solution, ensuring the software delivers real value to its users.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several key activities that ensure the software system meets business goals and user expectations. These activities help define what the system should do, how it should perform, and how stakeholders will interact with it.

1. Requirement Gathering

Involves collecting information from various stakeholders such as customers, end users, and business owners.

Techniques include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, brainstorming, and document analysis.

The goal is to understand the business problem and identify the key needs that the software should address.

2. Requirement Elicitation

Focuses on extracting clear and detailed requirements through interactive sessions.

Activities may include workshops, use-case studies, focus group discussions, and prototyping.

Helps uncover hidden or implied needs that stakeholders may not initially express.

3. Requirement Documentation

Involves recording and organizing the gathered and elicited requirements into a structured format.

Documents like the Software Requirements Specification (SRS), use case diagrams, and user stories are created.

This documentation serves as a reference throughout the project lifecycle.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

The collected requirements are examined for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and clarity.

Analysts may use data flow diagrams (DFDs), UML diagrams, or entity-relationship models (ERDs) to represent the system logically.

Helps the development team and stakeholders visualize the system and identify potential conflicts or redundancies.

5. Requirement Validation

Ensures that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are achievable within project constraints.

Techniques such as reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping are used.

The goal is to confirm that the right product is being built before moving into the design and development stages.

Types of Requirements

Requirements are generally classified into Functional and Non-functional types. Both are crucial for building a reliable and user-friendly system.

1. Functional Requirements

Definition:
Functional requirements define what the system should do — the specific behaviors, functions, or operations it must perform.

Examples (for the Hotel Booking Management System):

The system should allow users to search for hotels based on location, date, and price range.

The system should enable customers to book a room and receive an email/SMS confirmation.

Hotel managers should be able to add, update, or delete hotel listings.

The system should process secure online payments through third-party payment gateways.

Customers should be able to view and cancel their bookings through their dashboard.

2. Non-functional Requirements

Definition:
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions — covering aspects like performance, usability, reliability, and security.

Examples (for the Hotel Booking Management System):

Performance: The system should handle at least 10,000 concurrent users without downtime.

Reliability: The system uptime must be 99.9% to ensure continuous access.

Scalability: The architecture should support scaling across multiple servers to accommodate traffic spikes.

Security: User data and payment details should be encrypted using SSL/TLS standards.

Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and accessible on mobile and desktop devices.

Response Time: Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds.

Use Case Diagrams
What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram is a visual representation that illustrates how different actors (users or external systems) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. It’s part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and plays a vital role in Requirement Analysis, as it helps in understanding what the system should do from the end-user’s perspective.

Use Case Diagrams show:

Actors: The users or external systems that interact with the application.

Use Cases: The specific functionalities or actions the system performs.

Relationships: How actors connect with various use cases.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Provides a clear overview of system functionality.

Helps stakeholders and developers understand system boundaries.

Supports requirement validation by ensuring all user interactions are captured.

Acts as a communication bridge between technical and non-technical team members.

Serves as a foundation for creating test cases and further system modeling.

Acceptance Criteria
What is Acceptance Criteria?

Acceptance Criteria (AC) are the predefined conditions or statements that a software feature must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders or the end user. They serve as a bridge between requirements and testing, ensuring that every developed feature aligns with user expectations and project objectives.

In essence, acceptance criteria clearly define what “done” means for a feature.

Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Clarifies Requirements:
Acceptance criteria ensure that both developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what needs to be delivered.

Improves Quality:
By defining measurable outcomes, the development team can build features that meet exact specifications and avoid ambiguity.

Facilitates Testing:
QA teams use acceptance criteria as the basis for test cases, making it easier to verify that the system works as expected.

Prevents Scope Creep:
Clearly stating what’s “in” and “out” of scope helps control feature expansion during development.

Enhances Transparency:
Both developers and clients can track whether requirements have been met before approving the final release.

Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature in the Booking Management System

Feature: Checkout (Booking Payment Process)

Acceptance Criteria

The user must be logged in before accessing the checkout page.

The checkout page must display a summary of the booking details, including hotel name, room type, number of nights, total price, and taxes.

The system must allow the user to choose a payment method (e.g., credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer).

When the user confirms payment:

The system should process the payment securely through the third-party payment gateway.

The system should display a loading state during processing.

Upon successful payment:

The system must generate a booking confirmation ID.

The user should receive a confirmation email and SMS within one minute.

The booking details must be stored in the database.

If payment fails, the system must display an error message and allow the user to retry.

The entire checkout process (from loading to confirmation) must complete within 10 seconds under normal conditions.

The checkout page must be responsive and accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
